**CS3 Case Study Repository â€“ Paul Rosa**

## Recognizing ASL Digit Signs from Images

---

### **Contents of this Repository**

This repository is designed as a **case study challenge** to help students build and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can classify American Sign Language (ASL) digit signs (0â€“9) from static images. It contains all the materials youâ€™ll need to step into the shoes of a machine learning engineer and complete the project.

## **3. How to Get Started**

> This case study will walk you through building, training, and evaluating a CNN model that predicts ASL digit signs from static images.

**Steps:**

1. **Read the Hook Document:** Start with `Hook_Document.pdf` to understand the mission and high-level goals.
2. **Review the Rubric:** Check `Rubric.pdf` for detailed instructions and grading criteria.
3. **Prepare the Data:** Make sure you have the ASL digit dataset saved to your Google Drive at:  
   `/MyDrive/Sign-Language-Digits-Dataset/Dataset/` with subfolders `0` to `9`.
4. **Run the Notebook:** Open `ASL_Digit_CNN_Analysis.ipynb` in Google Colab and run each cell in order.
5. **Submit Your Work:** Follow the rubric to complete your notebook, report, and model evaluation.

## **5. Project Overview**

In this case study, youâ€™ll work with a dataset of ASL digit images (~2,000 samples) and build a CNN to classify hand signs from 0 to 9. The dataset is organized into labeled folders, and youâ€™ll walk through all key steps of a data science project:

- **Loading and preprocessing the data**
- **Building and training a CNN model**
- **Evaluating performance with accuracy, confusion matrices, and more**
- **Reflecting on model strengths and areas for improvement**

By the end, youâ€™ll have a solid understanding of how machine learning can be applied to real-world accessibility problemsâ€”and how to document your work like a pro.
